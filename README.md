#### Notes (Don't bother, it's for the devs):
1. Take screenshots of links that don't qualify in any social types.
2. Save scraped user data in db.

```ts
await page.screenshot({
    path:
      "C:/Users/Taruvar/Downloads/" +
      Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 + 0).toString() +
      ".png",
  });
```
2. Backup instagram data scrapper: 
```js
meta[name="description"]
```
